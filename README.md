# Bloons-TD-Battles-Mods
A couple of mods I made in 2019 for bloons TD battles

This is how you can make your own from what I remember:
You had to open the "data" file with 7zip using the password in the file i have provided. 
You could then edit the data file to change different parts of the game.
For example; in the crazy banana farms mod i changed the amount of money that a banana gives you to a very high amount, making the game very fun. You can have alot of fun with this, changing your anything you can think of.
Once edited you must open the file location of Bloons TD Battles and replace the "data" folder.
If you want to change the game back to normal you can either replace the data file with the BACKUP file that I have included, or choose the "Verify integrity of game files" option on steam.

WARNING:
From what I know this only works in friendly games, not random online games. It also may get you banned if the game detects your changes. Do this are your own risk.
